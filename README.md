# Device Database (device-db)

### Overview
The device database supported in ModusToolbox™ applies to all Infineon Technologies devices.

The database consists of a set of marketing devices distributed in a set of hierarchal directories.
Each marketing device contains a base view that describes the basic characteristics of the device and additional views as defined by applications that use the device-db asset.

This database is used by the ModusToolbox™ software. Do not use this repository directly.
