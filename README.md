# Device Database (device-db)

### Overview
Device database provides device information for project-creator, configurators,
and other ModusToolbox™ tools. The device database is tied to the PDL
(Peripheral Driver Library) packages available for different device categories.

The database is structured as hierarchical directory tree with device related
information defined at different hierarchy levels.
This information is consumed by ModusToolbox™ tools:
* Device Configurator and other BSP configurators - to display and configure peripheral resources.
* BSP Assistant - to create and configure the BSP for a given device/module part number.
* QSPI Configurator - to create and configure QSPI configuration for external memory chips.

This database is used by the ModusToolbox™ software. Do not use this repository directly.

See [DEVICES.md](./DEVICES.md) for a list of devices and modules supported by the device database.
